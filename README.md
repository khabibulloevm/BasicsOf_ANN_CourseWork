# Roadsign detection in DVR video
## This repo contains .ipymb files with trained models
1. YOLOV4
2. Faster-RCNN
2. RetinaNet-101
###  For Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet, Facebook's Detectron2 platform was used.
- Initial Dataset is in Yolo format.
- For Faster-RCNn and RetinaNet, dataset annotations are converted to its corresponding one using RoboFlow
- Outputs are inside the foldes. Video detection is done only to yolov4, for others are in process

### Dataset
- Dataset is initially in Yolo format
- Dataset divided into 518 train,148 valid, 74 test sets
- There are 4 classes in dataset
- For Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet, dataset is converted to its corresponding annotation
